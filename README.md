[OSRS] Thieving Bot Prototype

Supports:
  
  - Men (Lumbridge recommended)
  - Normal Farmer
  - Master Farmer (Draynor)
  - Silk Stall (Ardougne, the north one)
  - Nature Chest (Ardougne, upstairs)
  - Eating Food (Lobster only)
  - Banking For Food (Draynor Master Farmer & Ardougne Silk Stall)
  

For the Ardougne Silk Stall, start the script one square north of the northernmost silk stall.
For the Master Farmer, start in the center of the Draynor marketplace.
For the Nature Chest, start in front of the Nature Chest.
The code requires that you have some lobsters in your inventory.  Otherwise, it will bank and try to find more lobsters.  The code will withdraw 6 lobsters when < 10 HP && out of lobsters.

The code is open source, so feel free to adjust or suggest.  I mean it, I suck at coding, I have been coding for one month and could use the advice.
